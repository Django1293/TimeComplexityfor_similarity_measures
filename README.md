# Time complexity for  document similarity measures
The documents similarity measurements have several applications in the real world like to find the mirror site, plagarism checking etc. Here in this report I will descuss about the time complexities of two of the similarity measurements: Jaccard's and cosine similarity measurement theoretically as well as emperically. Also, the various types of implementation of cosine similarity measures like vector representation and sparse dictionary representaion will be compared with each other. After that all pair similarity measurements and its time complexity will be compared for both Jaccard's and cosine implemention and various other observations and how emperical findings differ from the theoretical predictions also will be dicussed. Finally, Map Reduce paradigm will be used to implement parallel processing for calculating all pair similarity.
